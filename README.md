#### This is a repo showing NftMarketPlace backend using solidity, ethers, and hardhat!


Nfts or non-fungible tokens are a huge thing in the crypto domain. Be it in metaverse or play-to-earn games, NFTs would play a huge role. But where do we buy Nfts and how do we sell them?

This is where NFT market place comes into the picture.

The famous NFT market places such as [opensea](https://opensea.io/) and [foundation](https://foundation.app/) are a great place to start buying NFTs.

However, as a web3 developer, you must to know how to develop such a market place.

I made this project while learning how to develop NFT market place and with the help of [PatrickAlphaC](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC)'s course.

Do check his repo and youtube channel for more development instructions.
